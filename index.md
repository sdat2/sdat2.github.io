## Simon D.A. Thomas

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Cambridge (on an MRes+PhD program @ai4er-cdt). 
My main interests are: 

 - climate physics, 
 - extreme value theory (EVT), 
 - and machine learning (ML).

I like to code, although I suspect that I am often verbose, and I do not write enough tests or comments.

Projects that I am currently involved in:

 - Detecting fronts in the Southern ocean using a numbe of different algorithms.
 - Looking at the return periods of storm surges produced by tropical cyclones in climate models.
 - Detecting biodivirsity using ML algorithms on earth observation products.
