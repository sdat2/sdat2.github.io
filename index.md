## Simon D.A. Thomas

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Cambridge (on an MRes+PhD program @ai4er-cdt). 

My main interests are: 

 - climate physics, 
 - extreme value theory (EVT), 
 - and machine learning (ML).

I like to code. I suspect that I am often verbose.

Check out my github for most of my code.

Projects that I am currently involved in:

 - Detecting fronts in the Southern ocean using a numbe of different algorithms.
 - Looking at the return periods of storm surges produced by tropical cyclones in climate models.
 - Detecting biodivirsity using ML algorithms on earth observation products.
 
My primary academic supervisor is Dr. Dan Jones of the British Antarctic Survey.

My intellectual inspirations are Kerry Emanuel, Nassim Taleb, Dan Chavas, David Mackay, Milton Friedman, and Roger Scruton.
