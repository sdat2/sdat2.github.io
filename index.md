### Summary

I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. I am funded through @ai4er-cdt MRes+PhD program. I have spent the past four years in the field of climate physics, using machine learning techniques and numerical models to generate novel insights. This has allowed me to gain good skills in writing software, data processing, and machine learning. I have worked successfully in both my individual and group projects, to achieve high-quality open-source science. 

My thesis `Optimally Emulating a Hurricane Storm Surge Model for Risk Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis' is based on emulating a realistic storm surge model (ADCIRC+SWAN).

I studied Natural Sciences (Physics, BA+MSc) at the University of Cambridge.
