### Letters collected so far

BA MSc MRes MA (Cantab)

### Summary

I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. I am funded through @ai4er-cdt MRes+PhD program.

My thesis `Optimally Emulating a Hurricane Storm Surge Model for Risk Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis' is based on emulating a realistic storm surge model (ADCIRC+SWAN).

I studied Natural Sciences (Physics, BA+MSc) at the University of Cambridge.

### Projects that I am currently involved in

 - Using sensitivity analysis on simplified global physical models to understand CMIP biases in the tropics.
   - <https://seager19.readthedocs.io/> 
 - Looking at the return periods of storm surges produced by tropical cyclones in climate models.

My primary academic supervisor is Dr. Dan Jones of the British Antarctic Survey.
