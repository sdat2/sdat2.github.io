I am a postgraduate student at the University of Cambridge (on an MRes+PhD program @ai4er-cdt). 

My main interests are: 

 - climate physics, 
 - extreme value theory (EVT), 
 - and machine learning (ML).

I like to code. I suspect that I am often verbose.

Check out my github for evidence.

I completed an integrated Master of Science (physics) degree at the University of Cambridge.

Projects that I am currently involved in:

 - Using sensitivity analysis on simplified global physical models to understand CMIP biases in the tropics.
   - <https://seager19.readthedocs.io/> 
 - Detecting fronts in the Southern Ocean using different algorithms.
   - <https://os.copernicus.org/preprints/os-2021-40/>
   - <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4740752>
 - Looking at the return periods of storm surges produced by tropical cyclones in climate models.
   - <https://gitlab.com/sdat2/surge>
   - <https://github.com/sdat2/surge>
 - Detecting habitat fragmentation using ML algorithms on earth observation products.
   - <https://geograph.readthedocs.io/> 
 
My primary academic supervisor is Dr. Dan Jones of the British Antarctic Survey.
